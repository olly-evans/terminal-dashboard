## IN-PROGRESS

# Notes 

- print info with correct padding for terminal cols.
- HORIZONTAL SCROLLING FOR SMALLER TERMINAL WIDTHS. START CURSOR AT SCREENCOLS-1.
- POTENTIALLY MAKE CX INCREMENT BY 10 OR SOMETHING OTHERWISE.

- better way to get the maximum width Con.cx can scroll.
- Better data structure i think for table data.


- Might be able to disable auto-wrap in disableRawMode(), but this will affect visualizer.
- setup welcome menu with algorithm selection using cursor.

- Could also add fn + arrkey to skip to top/bottom and far left/right.
- need to think about how user can draw barriers in a quick fashion one by one too slow and tedious to draw something meaningful.

- add button to reset everything to empty cells except perm_barriers.
