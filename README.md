## IN-PROGRESS

# Notes 
- make data struct for welcome row data.
- make this print in a dynamic manor.

- setup welcome menu with algorithm selection using cursor.

- Could also add fn + arrkey to skip to top/bottom and far left/right.
- need to think about how user can draw barriers in a quick fashion one by one too slow and tedious to draw something meaningful.

- add button to reset everything to empty cells except perm_barriers.
